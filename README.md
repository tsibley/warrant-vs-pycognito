Warrant and pyCognito are two Python libraries for talking to AWS Cognito.  The
latter is a fork of the former, and this repo is supporting material for
comparing where they've diverged (at least as of this moment in time).

The commit history in this repo detail how the source of each was transformed
to make comparison more informative, as well as the git commit ids of the
initial unmodified sources being compared.
